Quick Introduction
===================


Installation
------------

.. code-block:: console

    pip install gbox


----

A sample code for plotting various shapes, with default parameters, on the same figure

.. code-block:: python

   import gbox as gb
   from os import path
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 4)
   gb.Circle().plot(axis=axs[0, 0])
   gb.Ellipse().plot(axis=axs[0, 1])
   gb.RegularPolygon(3).plot(axis=axs[0, 2])
   gb.Rectangle().plot(axis=axs[0, 3])
   gb.BoundingBox2D().plot(axis=axs[1, 0])
   gb.CShape().plot(axis=axs[1, 1])
   gb.Capsule().plot(axis=axs[1, 2])
   gb.NLobeShape(3).plot(axis=axs[1, 3])
   plt.tight_layout()
   plt.savefig(path.join(path.dirname(__file__), "shapes.pdf"))
   plt.close()

It produces the following figure.

Methods
-------

Points
^^^^^^

Methods for working with points (at present in a plane)

.. code-block:: python

   import gbox as gb
   from numpy import array, pi

   points = gb.Points(array([[2.0, 3.0], [6.0, 6.5], [5.0, 8.0]]))
   print(points.x)  # x coordinates of points
   print(points.y)  # y coordinates of points
   print(len(points))  # 3, i.e., number of points
   print(points.dim)  # 2, i.e., the dimensions x and y
   points.append(array([[44.0, -5.0], ]), end=True)  # appends points at the end
   points.append(array([[44.0, -5.0], ]), end=False)  # appends points at the beginning
   points.close_loop()  # appends first point at the end
   points.transform(angle=1.5 * pi, dx=-2.5, dy=-4.1)  # rotates points in CCW direction by `angle=1.5 * pi` and
   # translates points by `dx` and `dy` along the `x` and `y` directions.
   points.reverse()  # reverses the order of points
   points.reflect(p1=(0.0, 5.0), p2=(-8.0, 1.0))  # reflects the points about the line joining `p1` and `p2`

Curves
^^^^^^

Methods for working with curves (at present in a plane)

.. code-block:: python

   import gbox as gb
   from numpy import pi

   line = gb.StraightLine(length=1.0, start_point=(2.0, 3.0), angle=pi / 2)
   # Creates straight line starting at a given point, of a given length and aligned at an angle with the positive x-axs
   line.num_locus_points = 200  # set the number of points along the locus, defaults to 100
   print(line.locus)  # points: Points along the locus of the line
   #
   ell_arc = gb.EllipticalArc(
     smj=2.0, smn=1.0, theta_1=0.25 * pi, theta_2=0.6 * pi, centre=(1.0, -5.0), smj_angle=0.45 * pi
   )
   # Creates an elliptical arc with specified `centre`, semi major and minor axes of lengths 2.0 and 1.0,
   # starting from `theta_1` to `theta_2` (w.r.t semi major axs) and the inclination of semi major axs `smj_angle`.
   print(ell_arc.locus)
   # points of arc along the locus, default to 100 point which can be set by `ell_arc.num_locus_points`
   #
   cir_arc = gb.CircularArc(r=2.5, theta_1=0.0 * pi, theta_2=1.25 * pi, centre=(2.0, 4.0))
   # Creates a circular arc with radius `r`, starting from `theta_1` and ending at `theta_2`

Closed Shapes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Methods for working with closed shapes (at present in a plane).
For all the shapes the following four common properties are defined


* ``locus``\ : ``Points`` kind of object containing the points along the locus of the shape. The number of points defaults to
  100 but can be set to a desired number.
* ``area``\ : Enclosed area of the respective shape
* ``perimeter``\ : Perimeter of the respective shape
* ``shape_factor``\ : A non-dimensional number used to quantify the non-circularity of the shape. It is defined as the
  ratio of the respective shape perimeter to the perimeter of the circle containing equivalent area.

The following snippet shows the various parameters or operations one can do on a closed shape, using the Circle as an example.

.. code-block:: python

   import gbox as gb
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   circle = gb.Circle(radius=2.0, cent=(3.0, 6.0))
   print(circle.area)  # prints circle area
   print(circle.perimeter)  # prints circle perimeter
   print(circle.shape_factor)  # returns shape factor: perimeter/equivalent circle perimeter.
   print(circle.locus)  # prints 50 points along the locus of circle
   # one can set the desired number of locus points as
   circle.num_locus_points = 251
   print(circle.locus)  # prints 251 points along the locus of the circle
   circle.plot()  # plots a circle displays using `matplotlib.pyplot.show()`
   circle.plot(f_path='/path/to/file')  # saves a plot at the specified path
   _, axis = plt.subplots()[1]
   circle.plot(axis=axis)  # plots circle on the axs object
   gb.Rectangle().plot(axis=axis)  # adds rectangle to the same axs

-------


Shapes List
^^^^^^^^^^^

``ShapesList``\ , ``ClosedShapesList`` are defined to work efficiently with multiple shapes. For all the closed
shapes list version is available which takes a single numpy array with the respective shape information.

For example,

.. code-block:: python

   import gbox as gb
   from numpy import array

   circles_data = array([
     [0.0, 0.0, 2.0],
     [2.0, 8.0, 3.2],
     [-2.0, 4.0, 1.2],
     [2.0, 4.0, 1.2],
   ])  # (4, 3) shaped array containing four circles information with first two columns (x, y) coordinates of
   # their centres and the last column contains radii.
   circles = gb.CircleSet1D(circles_data)
   circles.plot()  # plots circles on a given axs or to new axs (which can be saved or displayed using plt.show())
   print(circles.loci.points.shape)  # (num_circles, num_locus_points, 2) shaped array
   print(circles.areas)  # evaluates all circles areas
   print(circles.perimeters)  # evaluates all circles perimeters
   print(circles.shape_factors)  # evaluates all circles shape_factors
