WIP/Goals
---------


#.
    At present Only ``Circle`` and ``Ellipse`` contain the specified number of points on the locus. As, other shapes
    are made up of multiple elements, needs to find the right number of points on each element of the shape.
#.
    Convert ``Points(list)`` to ``Points(numpy.ndarray)`` and see if there is any performance gain
#.
    Updating the documentation

    - Add schematics of the shapes
    - Add formulae for all implementations of area, perimeter...etc.
#.
    UnS representation of closed shapes
#.
    Adding 3D shapes
