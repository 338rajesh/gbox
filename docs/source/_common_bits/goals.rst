WIP/Goals
---------


* At present Only ``Circle`` and ``Ellipse`` contain the specified number of points on the locus. As, other shapes are made
  up of multiple elements, needs to find the right number of points on each element of the shape.
* Convert ``Points(list)`` to ``Points(numpy.ndarray)`` and see if there is any performance gain
* Updating the documentation
* For multiple-shapes, having different colours for each kind of shapes. That is for example, all circles in blue,
  all ellipses in red...etc.
* Add support for ``*.json`` and ``*.dat`` or ``*.txt`` files in unit cell data
* Add support for multiprocessing in plotting and getting image arrays in unit-cell operations
*
